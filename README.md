# Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning (WI4635)

This repository contains the code developed for the two assigments of this course.
Project 1 is the implementation of some clustering algorithms (KMeans, Kernel KMeans,
Spectral and Normalized Spectral Clustering), as well as the implementation of an
eigensolver from scratch (QR-based). Project 2 implements a Grid Search and a Bayesian
Optimizer for hyperparameter optimization.

Each project has its own README.
